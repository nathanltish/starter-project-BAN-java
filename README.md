# Unit 1 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 1 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._
## Requirements: ##
- Tie it to a real-world topic:
  - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc.
OR 
  - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
- Must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered so far: data/typecasting, basic output, formatted output, static methods and parameters. Specifically:
  - At least 5 data variables, and use of String, int, and double
  - At least 2 distinct static method definitions per group member used in your program in a useful way
  - Demonstration of some sort of calculation or transformation of data
  - Formatted output used in a meaningful way

## Resources: ##
OLI Modules + Lecture Videos for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy

Labs for larger examples, getting inspiration or ideas
